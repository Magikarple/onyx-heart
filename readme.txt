# RPG Project

Open world procedural tile-based RPG, made in Godot.


## Rambling Technical Description

Firstly, the world is split into two levels of large detail:
Zones and Points (I may rename the latter to "Places")

Further, at the smallest level of detail is Tiles, which are physical squares
that the player can interact with and move on.


The world is procedurally generated with continuous noise to create continuous
biomes throughout the world.
